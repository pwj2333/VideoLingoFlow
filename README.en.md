An AI-powered automation & creation framework built around **local-first, infinitely extensible, and multi-user collaborative** principles. It turns video subtitling, translation, dubbing, editing, AI enhancement, batch production, and multi-platform publishing into a three-pillar system — **node-based workflows + chat-driven Agent execution + pluggable capability interfaces**. Whether you are a solo creator, a studio, or a distributed team, you can orchestrate any task with the same framework.

> **In one sentence**: every task is a visual node graph; every capability is a pluggable interface; every instruction executes via conversation. Nodes, interfaces, and Agents combine freely — infinite tasks, full freedom.

---

## Why This Framework

Traditional automation tools hard-code features, require code changes to extend, and rely on manual file transfer for collaboration. VideoLingoFlow addresses three fundamental problems by design:

- **A standardized task model**: every task is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Each node is a reusable capability unit; nodes pass data through semantically-typed ports. Task = graph; graph = saveable, reusable, re-runnable in batch, and shareable.
- **Capabilities decoupled from orchestration**: capability interfaces (ASR / TTS / image generation / source separation / AIGC / publishing…) are fully separated from orchestration. Adding a capability means registering one interface — **zero changes to the orchestration layer**. Conversely, reshaping a production pipeline is just drag-and-drop wiring — zero changes to the capability layer.
- **Extensible by everyone**: the framework ships three extension mechanisms — **custom nodes**, **new capability interfaces**, and **Agent-as-a-node**. Extensions mount like plugins without touching the framework core.

> That is why this is not just a "video tool" — it is a **creation operating system** that can host any AI workflow.

Here are a few previews of the workbench UI:

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Node-Based Workflows with Custom Nodes

A visual DAG canvas built on `@xyflow/react` ships with **80+ built-in nodes** covering input, platform download, audio, ASR, translation, subtitles, dubbing, composition, image generation, and publishing. Highlights:

- **Custom nodes**: add a node with the "definition + execution step + rule validation + registration" four-piece convention. Field-level validation, semantic port wiring, and artifact layout rules are all built in.
- Workflows can be saved, reused, and re-run in batch; node-level artifact management and cleanup are handled automatically by the control plane.

![Workflow canvas](docs/images/flows.png)

### 2. Capability Interfaces — Add Any, Freely

The capability layer is organized by **interface domains**: ASR / TTS / image generation / source separation / AIGC / publishing. Each domain supports **switching between multiple providers** (e.g., ASR: WhisperX, FunASR, Qwen3-ASR, ElevenLabs…). Adding a new capability interface = define the data model + implement the invocation + register the domain — **no orchestration changes required**. Example: to integrate a new TTS provider, register a TTS interface and every workflow immediately gains it.

### 3. Chat-Driven Agent Task Execution

The built-in project assistant **"Pi"** lets you command the entire pipeline in **natural language**:

- **Configure interfaces**: switch and configure capability interfaces through conversation;
- **Create nodes**: describe what you need and the Agent generates the custom node definition and steps;
- **Schedule tasks**: issue tasks verbally; the Agent parses them into workflows and dispatches execution;
- **Troubleshoot & organize**: stream conversations to debug issues, organize files, and prepare publishing.

Pi supports six roles (General / Node Creation / Workflow Orchestration / Task Execution / File Organization / Publishing), keeps session history, and supports tool calls.

### 4. Agent-as-a-Node — Orchestrate Freely

The framework implements Agents as **built-in node types** (`pi_agent` general agent node, `editor_agent` editing agent node). You can drag an Agent directly onto the canvas and wire it with regular capability nodes — **the Agent is both a conversation assistant and a step in the pipeline**. Outputs from previous steps feed into the Agent, and the Agent's output flows to downstream nodes. Text-command-driven execution and visual orchestration merge seamlessly.

### 5. Infinite Tasks with Batch & Scheduling

- **Batch workbench**: import multiple assets at once, run tasks in parallel with rate limiting and failure retries;
- **Lifecycle management**: orchestrated by the control plane (FastAPI + SQLite + Redis/Celery) with resource queues (GPU / TTS / LLM / IO), health checks, Prometheus metrics, and backup/restore.

## Collaboration & Community

### 6. Shared Community — One-Click Share & Import of Nodes and Workflows

- Package custom **nodes** and **workflows** and upload them to the cloud community (Cloudflare Worker + R2 + D1);
- Browse the community and **one-click import** mature flows shared by others — reuse instantly;
- Team know-how becomes distributable assets, shared with the world.

### 7. Multi-User Collaboration — LAN / Internet / Remote Control

Built on a user / role / project permission system + real-time WebSocket collaboration:

- **LAN mode**: collaboration within a trusted local network, enabled instantly;
- **Internet remote mode (Remote)**: exposes a public domain via Cloudflare Tunnel for real-time collaboration across sites. Off by default; public access is blocked by `RemoteAccessGuard`;
- Project-level resource center (upload/download assets & artifacts), member approval, audit logs, and a process manager panel (Manager port 18001) for remote monitoring and control.

### 8. Teams & Remote Work

Members can edit workflows simultaneously, maintain shared project resources, watch task progress and logs remotely, and start/stop services remotely. One framework covers the collaboration and remote-work needs of **studios, MCNs, and cross-city teams**.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (`*.bat` scripts) / Linux / macOS
- Python 3.12 (auto-downloaded by installer if missing), Node.js ≥ 18, Redis (auto-started by Manager)
- Optional: NVIDIA GPU + CUDA (local model inference)

### 1. First-Time Install

> 💡 If this install/deployment process is too complex for you, I've also prepared an **all-in-one Windows package** (compatible with 50-series NVIDIA GPUs). Download: [https://pan.quark.cn/s/b1f892f56a65](https://pan.quark.cn/s/b1f892f56a65)

Run `install.bat` (`install.sh` on Linux/macOS): auto-checks/installs Python 3.12 and Node.js, installs backend dependencies (PyTorch trio selected automatically by platform & CUDA), and installs third-party extensions.

### 2. One-Click Start

Run `start.bat` (or `bash start.sh` on Linux/macOS). Manager runs Alembic migrations, initializes the VoiceForge DB, starts Redis and all services; the frontend runs as a Vite dev server (port 11003).

**Production mode**: run `start-prod.bat` / `start-prod.sh`. No Vite dev server — the frontend build is served same-origin by the backend (`frontend/dist` is reused if present; `--rebuild` forces a rebuild). Open `http://127.0.0.1:11001/` for the production UI.

| Service | Address | Port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Process Manager | http://127.0.0.1:18001 | 18001 |
| Main backend (API + frontend) | http://127.0.0.1:11001 | 11001 |
| Frontend dev server | http://localhost:11003 | 11003 |
| Social backend / MCP | http://127.0.0.1:5409 / 5410 | 5409 / 5410 |
| Social frontend | http://localhost:5173 | 5173 |
| LLM Router | http://127.0.0.1:8800 | 8800 |
| Cutia editor | http://127.0.0.1:4100 | 4100 |
| Redis | 127.0.0.1:6379 | 6379 |

Open http://127.0.0.1:11001/ in your browser to enter the workbench.

### 3. Health Checks

- Liveness: `GET /api/health/live`; readiness: `GET /api/health/ready` (validates schema, data dir, Redis, Celery worker); metrics: `GET /api/metrics`

## Docker Deployment

Besides the local "script-based install" mode, the project also ships a **production / cluster deployment** via Docker (under `deploy/`). It uses a single image for both the API (`uvicorn`) and the task Worker (`celery worker`), backed by a full stack of PostgreSQL + Redis + MinIO + Nginx.

> Image design notes: a unified `python:3.12-slim` base; PyTorch `cu128` / `cpu` wheels select GPU / CPU, and GPU acceleration only needs `--gpus all` at runtime; the frontend is compiled at build time and served same-origin by the backend. See `deploy/README.md` for full details.

### Requirements

- Docker Engine and Docker Compose v2 installed.
- Optional: NVIDIA GPU with the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/) installed (for GPU inference).

### 1. Prepare the environment file

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set strong random passwords for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`, etc., and adjust `API_PORT` / `HTTPS_PORT` as needed. Keep `TORCH_INDEX=cu128` (default) for GPU; set `TORCH_INDEX=cpu` for a CPU-only build (smaller image).

### 2. Prepare TLS certificates (required by the HTTPS proxy)

```bash
mkdir -p deploy/tls
# place your certificates at deploy/tls/fullchain.pem and deploy/tls/privkey.pem
```

See `deploy/TLS.md` for the strategy. For a local self-signed test, generate one following that doc.

### 3. Build the image

```bash
# default GPU (cu128)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env build api

# CPU-only build (smaller image)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env build --build-arg TORCH_INDEX=cpu api
```

The `worker` service reuses the same image, so building `api` covers both.

### 4. Start dependencies and run migrations

```bash
# start PostgreSQL / Redis / MinIO
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env up -d postgres redis minio

# run versioned migrations (the only DB schema entry point)
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env run --rm --no-deps api alembic upgrade head
```

### 5. Start all services

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env up -d api worker proxy
```

- `api`: FastAPI + same-origin frontend (port `11001`; exposed externally via Nginx on `HTTPS_PORT`).
- `worker`: Celery Worker consuming tasks by resource queue (GPU / TTS / LLM / IO).
- `proxy`: Nginx reverse proxy + HTTPS termination.

### 6. Verify

```bash
curl -k https://localhost/api/health/live    # process alive
curl -k https://localhost/api/health/ready   # deps (PostgreSQL schema / Redis / MinIO / Worker) ready
```

Open `https://<host>/` (HTTPS port, default `443`) in your browser to enter the workbench.

### Enable GPU inference

Under the `api` and `worker` services in `deploy/docker-compose.yml`, uncomment the `# deploy.resources` block (requires the NVIDIA Container Toolkit on the host). On first start, models download into the mounted volume `/app/_model_cache`; subsequent starts are faster because the volume persists.

### Persistence & data

The following directories are persisted as named volumes and survive container recreation:

| Volume | Container path | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app-data` | `/app/voiceforge_data` | VoiceForge data |
| `app-data-root` | `/app/data` | Control-plane task data |
| `app-model-cache` | `/app/_model_cache` | HuggingFace model cache |
| `app-temp` | `/app/temp` | Temp artifacts (preview videos, etc.) |

### Common ops commands

```bash
# tail logs
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env logs -f api worker

# stop / recreate
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env down
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env up -d --force-recreate api worker
```

> For full image design, caveats, and troubleshooting, see `deploy/README.md`.

## Configuration

- **Runtime config**: `.runtime/local_env.bat` is generated on first install from `.runtime/local_env.bat.template`. Re-running `install.bat` **backfills keys newly added to the template (existing values are never overwritten)** and recomputes `GPU_SERVICE_*` / resource-token keys from the detected VRAM. Add new configurable switches to the template.
- **LAN collaboration**: set `VIDEOLINGO_LAN_MODE=1` in `local_env.bat` (or toggle it on the Collaboration page) and restart Manager. API and Manager then listen on `0.0.0.0` (trusted LAN only).
- **Remote collaboration**: enable Remote mode on the "Collaboration" page (public domain via Cloudflare Tunnel). Off by default — public requests are blocked by `RemoteAccessGuard`.
- **Model cache**: stored under `_model_cache/`; `HF_ENDPOINT` defaults to `https://hf-mirror.com`.

![Global settings](docs/images/setting.png)
- **Backup/restore**: after stopping Manager, `python scripts/control_plane_backup.py backup/restore` (see `deploy/README.md`).
- **Docker cluster deployment** (PostgreSQL + Redis + MinIO + Nginx): see `deploy/README.md`; the only DB migration entry is `alembic upgrade head`.
